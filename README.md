# Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project by Adey Innovations Inc. aims to enhance the detection of fraudulent activities in e-commerce and bank credit transactions. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the system identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and employing geolocation analysis.

## Business Need

The primary goal is to strengthen transaction security for e-commerce platforms and banks, preventing financial losses and fostering trust among customers and financial institutions.

## Features

- Analyze and preprocess transaction data.
- Feature engineering to identify fraud patterns.
- Build and train various machine learning models.
- Evaluate and refine model performance.
- Deploy models for real-time fraud detection.

## Data

Datasets utilized include:
- **Fraud_Data.csv**: Contains e-commerce transaction details.
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Maps IP addresses to countries.
- **creditcard.csv**: Contains bank transaction data curated for fraud analysis.

## Technologies

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, etc.
- **Model Deployment**: Flask for API development and serving.
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating isolated environments.
- **Dashboard**: Dash for visualizing insights from the data.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nebiyu-getachew/Fraud-Detection.git
cd Fraud-Detection
cd Dashboard
